Some ideas for how I can improve the dev experience and existing projects.

-Replace links to code which allows LaTeX style math equations with something
 from webpack to reduce the load time for math equations (by negating the need
 to load the relevant scripts from a 3rd party website everytime).

-Make it so that my html files are no longer static, but rather compressed for
 smaller webpage size (and thus faster loading).
