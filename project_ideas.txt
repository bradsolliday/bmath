Some ideas for projects I can do in the future.

-Implement trick to calculate logs, square roots, and the like by exploiting
 how the bytes of floats, when written as an int, form a number proportional
 to the log somehow. This is also a chance to become better aquanted with
 numerical precision and the like. (Oh, there's a wikipedia page on the fast
 inverse square root that's relevant).

-Create an interactive demo of the unique degree k polynomial given values at
 k+1 distinct point. Like, the user would click on the graph and a polynomial
 will be plotted passing through their clicked points. This would be done in
 javascript.

-One thing I would like to do is write code to calculate model the cache
 layout and analyze compiled code to identify whether cache misses and the like
 are occuring and whether the bus lines are being effectively used (like, to
 simulate to see what percentage of the data being loaded from memory is
 actually being used and what percent of memory accesses have the full width of
 the bus line actually used). Would need it to be somewhat module to accomadate
 the fact that different cache layouts are possible.

-I never did finish that section for calculating eigenstates. Should
 refamiliarize myself with that and finish it.

-I should so something where I simulate balls on springs. Just to refamiliarize
 myself with how it is done.
