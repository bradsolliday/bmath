Since I invariably forget what I need to do in order to update the website, I'm
writing my notes on the process here.

First, if some time has passed, important programs (for example, rimraf) may
have been deleted. If that's happened, in this directory (www), run
[npm install]

To then get the dev server up and running, run [npm run start]
For an exmplanation of the npm run commands (to see what they are an alias
for), the commands are defined in the package.json file under scripts.
