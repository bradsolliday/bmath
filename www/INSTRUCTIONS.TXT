It's a bit complicated to build and deploy the website, so I'll include
instructions here.

Commands will be surrounded by brackets

THESE COMMANDS ASSUME YOU'RE IN THE WWW DIRECTIORY UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE

1) run [./update_docs.sh]
2) run [npm run build]
3) run [mv dist ../..]
4) run [git checkout gh-pages]
5) run [rm -rf *]
6) run [mv ../dist/* .]
7) run [git add .]
8) run [git commit]
9) run [git push]

And then you're done, to return to master run
[git checkout master]


THE BELOW IS DEPRECATED
(I keep it only for the subtree stuff)

-> First, enter [ npm run build ]
This builds the distribution in the dist folder. This is what gh-pages
needs to actually serve the website.

-> Second, enter [ git add dist && git commit ]
This will add the distribution and commit. It will open up vim so that you
can type the git commit message.

-> Third, enter [ git push origin --delete gh-pages ]
This removed the old branch that github serves the website from. This is
needed to avoid some difficulties I encountered elsewhere. Just leave out
this step if you're curious what those difficulties were.

-> Fourth, navigate up one directory [ cd .. ] to bmath, then enter
[ git subtree push --prefix www/dist origin gh-pages ]
This pushes the new website to the gh-pages branch for github to serve.
