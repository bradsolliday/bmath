It's a bit complicated to build and deploy the website, so I'll include
instructions here.

Commands will be surrounded by brackets

THESE COMMANDS ASSUME YOU'RE IN THE WWW DIRECTIORY UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE

-> First, enter [ npm run build ]
This builds the distribution in the dist folder. This is what gh-pages
needs to actually serve the website.

-> Second, enter [ git add dist && git commit ]
This will add the distribution and commit. It will open up vim so that you
can type the git commit message.

-> Third, enter [ git push origin --delete gh-pages ]
This removed the old branch that github serves the website from. This is
needed to avoid some difficulties I encountered elsewhere. Just leave out
this step if you're curious what those difficulties were.

-> Fourth, navigate up one directory [ cd .. ] to bmath, then enter
[ git subtree push --prefix www/dist origin gh-pages ]
This pushes the new website to the gh-pages branch for github to serve.
