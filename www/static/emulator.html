    <h2>The Idea of The Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2020 I had just cracked open Donald E. Knuth's <i>
            The Art of Computer Programming Vol. 1
        </i> for the first time. I didn't get
        very far before something he said caught my attention and had me
        distracted. Namely, he started tossing out ideas for how one might
        rigorously define an algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        The example he used was to define an algorithm as a quadruple
        \((Q,I,\Omega,f)\), where Q is a set (representing the set of states
        our data could take on), I is a subset of Q (representing the set of
        initial states), \(\Omega\) is another subset of Q (representing the
        set of terminal states, and thus the output of the algorithm), and f
        is a function \(f:Q\rightarrow Q\) s.t. f is the identity on
        \(\Omega\) (representing the process of the algorithm).
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is to pick an initial state in I and repeatedly
        apply f to get a new state until our new state is an element of
        \(\Omega\). Then the algorithm is done.
    </p>
    <p>
        This seems simple and reasonable enough of a model for algorithms, but
        Knuth quickly pointed out that this definition allows Q to contain
        states that can't be discerned in a finite amount of time, like an
        infinite sequence (for example, if someone starts giving you a decimal
        expansion that for the first 1,000,000 digits is equal to that of
        \(\pi\), how do you know the number you have is actually equal to
        \(\pi\) and isn't some other real number quite close to it?).
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, this does not meet Knuth's standard of
        <i>effectiveness</i>
        , which requires that all the operations must be sufficiently basic
        that a person could in principle be done by a person with pencil and
        paper in a finite amount of time. To address this, he suggests a
        restriction on the quadruple.
    </p>
    <p>
        Namely, let A (for alphabet) be a finite set of letters, A* be the set
        of all strings of letters in A (i.e., all finite ordered sequences of
        elements of A, including the empty sequence).
    </p>
    <p>
        To create our new quadruple, we're going to imagine a set of N rules
        which tell you how to modify a string in A*. Our set of states Q is
        then the set of pairs \((\sigma,j\)), where \(\sigma\) is a string in
        A* and j is the number of one of our rules (an integer in [0, N)), or
        N itself. The
        idea being that our set of states Q is the set of strings coupled with
        the next rule to apply (or possibly the ruleless number N, but well get
        to that).
    </p>
    <p>
        The set of initial states, I, is then then the states of the form
        \((\sigma,0)\), i.e., any string coupled with the initial rule to
        apply, rule 0. Conversely, the set of final states, \(\sigma\),
        is the set of states of the form \((\sigma,N)\). It's ok that N
        doesn't correspond to a rule as we don't need to act on terminal
        states.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, our rules tell us what f does to our states (both how the
        string is modified and what rule to apply next). In order to elaborate,
        I'll need to first supply some of Knuth's notation: If \(\theta\) and
        \(\sigma\) are strings in A*, we say that \(\theta\) occurs in
        \(\sigma\) if \(\sigma\) has the form \(\alpha\theta\omega\) for
        strings \(\alpha\theta\omega\).
    </p>
    <p>
        The \(j^{th}\) rule is then a string \(\theta_j\) we are seeking, a
        string \(\phi_j\) we'll use as a replacement for \(\theta\) if it can
        be found, the number \(p_j\) of the next rule to apply if \(\theta_j\)
        is present, and the number \(n_j\) of the next rule to apply if
        \(\theta_j\) is not present.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last component of our quadruple, the function f, is then defined
        by applying the rule of a state to that state:<br />
        If \(\theta_j\) does not occur in \(\sigma\):
        $$f(\sigma,j) = (\sigma, n_j)$$
        If \(\theta_j\) does occur in \(\sigma\):
        $$f(\sigma,j) = (\alpha\phi_j\omega, p_j)$$
        where \(\alpha\) is the shortest string such that
        &emsp;\(\alpha\theta_j\omega=\sigma\).<br />
        If j does not correspond to a rule, i.e., is N and our state is a
        terminal state:
        $$f(\sigma, N) = (\sigma, N)$$
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I don't know about you, but I found this to be quite a strange
        sort of algorithm. After finishing his description, Knuth simply
        asserted that the method is powerful enough to do anything we can do by
        hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feeling unsatisfied, I decided I wanted to see an actual example of
        such an algorithm; and, having just learned about Euclid's algorithm
        for calculating greatest common divisors (see
        <a href="weblog/euclid_algorithm_page.html">here</a>), I decided to
        calculate gcd's using this method.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make a long story shorter, I came up with a solution, but it was more
        complicated and less efficient than needed because I didn't realize
        empty strings are allowed. Luckily, later in the process I realized
        to come up with such a ruleset was one of the problems for the section
        with a solution provided at the end of the book. This solution was
        essentially the same as my solution, except made use of this trick to
        greatrly reduce the number of steps needed by the algorithm. I'll use
        Knuth's solution going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules are hard to make sense of on their own, so I'll explain the
        idea of it first. Like Euclid's algorithm, this algorithm is recursive
        and replaces a pair of numbers with a smaller pair of numbers whose gcd
        is the same. Since each step reduces the size of our numbers,
        eventually one of the numbers becomes 1, and the gcd is just the other
        number.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, unlike Euclid's algorithm, rather than dividing and taking the
        remainder, we simply use subtraction, and note that if m > n, then
        gcd(m, n) = gcd(m - n, n) (a divisor of m and n is also a divisor of
        m-n and n, so the largest divisor of one pair is also the largest
        divisor of the other).
    </p>
    <p>
        With the high level strategy established, we can emulate this with
        strings as follows: we initially represent the pair (m, n) that we
        wish to take the gcd of as m a's follwed by n b's. We can subtract
        the smaller from the larger by replacing an occurence of "ab" with
        the empty string "", and then immediately replacing the first occurence
        of the empty string "" with "c" (which is to simply append a "c" to the
        front; this is the improvement of Knuth's method upon mine).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Example:</b><br />
        &emsp;aaaaabbbb -> ccccaa <i>or</i><br />
        &emsp;aaaabbbbb -> ccccbb
    </p>
    <p>
        If we repeat these two steps until we can no longer, we will have no
        more remaining a's [or b's], have m [n] c's at the start of the string
        followed by n-m [m-n] b's [a's]. Now, we can return our string to a
        form similar to our initial state by replacing all a's with b's, and
        then all c's with a's.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Example:</b><br />
        &emsp;ccccaa -> ccccbb -> aaaabb <i>or</i><br />
        &emsp;ccccbb -> ccccbb -> aaaabb
    </p>
    <p>
        Since after this cycle, the gcd of the number of a's and the number of
        b's will remain the same (and either the number of a's or b's has
        decreased), eventually either the number of a's or the number of b's
        will equal the gcd(m, n). It will also consequently be a divisor of
        the other number, and after enough subtractions, there will be the same
        number of a's and b's (both equal to the gcd), and on a final
        subtraction, we'll be left with the same number of c's , which will then
        turn into that many a's.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Example:</b><br />
        &emsp;aaaabb -full-cycle-> aabb -> cc -> cc -> aa
    </p>
    <p>
        We can thus guarentee that after repeating the cycle enough, we'll be
        left with a number of a's equal to the gcd of m and n. Thus, to check
        if the algorithm should be finished, we just search for a "b". If we can
        find one, we know to subtract again. If we can't, we terminate the
        algorithm and mark down the number of a's as our answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, with the idea of the method described, it should hopefully be
        easier to make sense of precise description.
    </p>
    <p>
        The alphabet is A = {a, b, c}, N = 5, and the algorithm is initialized
        to m a's followed by n b's and j = 0, and terminates in gcd(m, n) a's
        and j = N. The rules are<br />
        <b>Rule 0:</b>
        Seek "ab"; if found replace with "" and go to rule 1, otherwise go to
        rule 2.<br />
        <b>Rule 1:</b>
        Seek ""; if found replace with "c" and go to rule 0, otherwise go to
        rule 0.<br />
        <b>Rule 2:</b>
        Seek "a"; if found replace with "b" and go to rule 2, otherwise go to
        rule 3.<br />
        <b>Rule 3:</b>
        Seek "c"; if found replace with "a" and go to rule 3, otherwise go to
        rule 4.<br />
        <b>Rule 0:</b>
        Seek "b"; if found replace with "b" and go to rule 0, otherwise go to
        rule 5.
