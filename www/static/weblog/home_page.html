        <h3>What This Is All About</h3>
        <p>It happens often. I have an idea - some project in mind. Sometimes it's practical, like a program to mash up some pdf's I've collected. But more often than not, when I explain the idea to my roomates, the reaction is "Cool, but... why?"</p>
        <p>Really, it's because it's fun. To witness something, to explore an interesting idea, to practice my skills, or to just prove that I <i>can</i>. But people don't like that sort of explanation as much, so that's what I've made this blog for - to give my work a veneer of professionality. Now when they ask why, I'll say "it's for my portfolio".</p>
        <p>But here you'll find some of my projets, usually with a mathematical aspect, with demos, the source code, and some lessons I've taken away from each one. I hope you find these half as interesting as I have. Enjoy!</p>
