    <main>
      <div id="introduction">
        <p>This website is built and maintained by Bradley Solliday to demo various cool ideas and his code</p>
        <p>All the code demonstrated here can be found on the linked github repository (including the files for building this website).</p>
        <p>This site is hosted on Github pages, meaning all the content on it is statically served. I'm using React to make writing the user interface easier, and webpack as my bundler. While the underlying repository is written mostly in Rust, The rust library, wasm-bindgen, makes it easy to export the code into Web Assembly, and the wasm-pack plugin makes it easy to import the resulting Web Assembly in javascript.</p>

      <h2>Calculating Prime Numbers</h2>
      <p>Below is a demo of a method of calculating prime numbers based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but modified to allow the calculation of arbitrarily large prime numbers. See the documentation for the implementation <strong><a href="./doc/bmath/struct.PCache.html">here</a></strong> (note, the code is written in Rust).</p>
      <p>Beware, I haven't yet gotten around to setting the code to run in the background, so if it takes a moment to calculate the first 1 million primes, think twice before adding another zero as the user interface will freeze until the calculation is complete (you can always close and reopen the page of course).</p>
      <div id="primes"></div>

      <h2>Calculating Greatest Common Divisors</h2>
      <p>When I first started learning html, css, and Javascript, I started making a weblog to learn the languages and to share interesting ideas. The experiment was enlightening, if a bit laborious, and motivated me to look into Web Assembly (to allow me to reuse code), React (to ease the creation of user interfaces), Babel (to make React easier to use), Webpack (to make Babel and Terser easier to use, and later because I began to appreciate the dev-server and build enviornment), which culminated in this page you're on now.</p>
      <p>Anyway, the one page I had completed before redirecting my efforts was on calculating GCDs. I thought I did a pretty good job of explaining Euclid's algorithm there, so I'd figure I'd link the relevant page. Keep in mind, the blog was unfinished, so don't count on anything but the GCD stuff working.</p>
