        <p>This website is built and maintained by Bradley Solliday to demo various cool ideas and his code</p>
        <p>All the code demonstrated here can be found on the linked github repository (including the files for building this website).</p>
      </div>

      <p>Below is a demo of a method of calculating prime numbers based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but modified to allow the calculation of arbitrarily large prime numbers. See the documentation for the implementation <strong><a href="./doc/bmath/struct.PCache.html">here</a></strong> (note, the code is written in Rust).</p>
      <p>Beware, I haven't yet gotten around to setting the code to run in the background, so if it takes a moment to calculate the first 1 million primes, think twice before adding another zero as the user interface will freeze until the calculation is complete (you can always close and reopen the page of course).</p>
